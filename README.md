# Full Stack Todo Application with Prisma ORM and MongoDB starter code

In this README, I will provide a detailed overview of what you'll be building and how to get started.

## What You Will Learn

1. **Setting up Prisma ORM:** You'll learn how to integrate Prisma ORM into your Next.js application.

2. **Connecting Prisma to MongoDB:** I will guide you through the process of connecting Prisma to your MongoDB database.

3. **Reading and Writing Data:** You'll learn how to create, read, update, and delete todo items from your MongoDB using Prisma.

## Beginner-Friendly

This tutorial is designed for the beginners who may not have extensive experience with Next.js and MongoDB.

- **No Prior MongoDB Experience Required:** You don't need to be well-versed in MongoDB. I'll walk you through all the necessary steps to connect Prisma to your MongoDB.

- **Basic Next.js Knowledge:** If you have a basic understanding of Next.js, you'll be well-equipped to follow along. I'll explain each step in a way that's easy to grasp.

Now, let's get started with building our full-stack todo application using our starter code.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the starter repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chukwudinweze/todo-app-prisma-mongodb-starter-code.git
```

### Install the Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using either Yarn or npm:

```bash
cd todo-app-prisma-mongodb-starter-code
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

To launch the development server and see our todo app in action, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the result. You can interact with the starter application locally to ensure everything is set up correctly.

You can also access it on Vercel at [https://todo-app-prisma-mongodb-starter-code.vercel.app/](https://todo-app-prisma-mongodb-starter-code.vercel.app/).

Now, you're all set to start!
